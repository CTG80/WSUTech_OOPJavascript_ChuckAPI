For this project, we will use the Chuck Norris Jokes API. (https://api.chucknorris.io/) 

Write a script that makes an http request to the Chuck Norris Jokes API, takes the response object, and outputs the random joke to an HTML page.  
Your script should contain a button to make the inital request and to request a new random joke.
